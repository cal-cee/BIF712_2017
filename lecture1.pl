#this file is a perl program file (recognized by the .pl extension)
#every line that begins with a # is a comment and is ignored by the perl interpreter
#comments are meant for human eyes, they're a type of documentation
#the perl interpreter is a compiled program that reads and executes perl script

#to display information on the screen from within perl use the 'print' statement
#historically, the first computer program that a programmer writes is "hello world"
print "hello world!";
#notice every statement (instruction/command/line) in perl ends with the semicolon ';'
#exercise: use print 3 times to display 3 different messages, try reordering the messages
#special "escape characters" allow us to insert special characters in our output
#ex. \n (they all begin with the backslash '\')
print "\nthis is another message!\n";
print "this is the final message, goodbye!";
